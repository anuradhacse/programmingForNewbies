1. Introduction to Python
    By Gudio van Rossum
    Named after Monty Python's Flying Circus comedy program (has 4 seasons, telecased in 1969)
    High Level, Structured and open source language, cross platform, Huge community, Large eco system
    
    interpreted programming language(Automatically compiled into bytecode before execution by an interpreter)
       
     python is very popular language, used for multi purpose
       - Data analysis, web development, mobile development, AL/ML, automation
       
2. Introduction to command line interface.(cli)
     
     Inclass
        ----------
        QUIZ - What basic tools do you need to start programming?
                  - A computer, a text editor, the shell(terminal), and a compiler/interpreter
               
               What command would you use for the following in bash (CLI)?
               Check your current directory - pwd
               Change to a directory named ‘bin’ (bin is in your current directory) - cd bin
               make a new directory called ‘lib’ - mkdir lib
               create a new file called ‘book.py’ - touch book.py
               list all the contents the current directory - ls

3.Setting up development environment.
   Linux
   Windows
   differences of python versions 2,3 (https://www.guru99.com/python-2-vs-python-3.html)
   
   pythons has 2 major versions (not backward compatible)
      -python 2
      -python 3
      
   interpreted programming vs compile programming
     - by example - https://guide.freecodecamp.org/computer-science/compiled-versus-interpreted-languages/
     - in compiled languages the source code is tranlated directly to bytecode(which is understadable by hardware)
      ex: c, c++, Go
      you have to compile first before run.
     - In interpreted language the source is tranlated to bytecode line by line by an inbuilt interpreter.
       you can directly run the program. Ex : Python
       
     Create a python file from terminal an run it using python.
     print 'Hello Srilanka'
     
     Do the same with IDLE
