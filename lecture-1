1. Introduction to Python
    By Gudio van Rossum
    Named after Monty Python's Flying Circus comedy program (has 4 seasons, telecased in 1969)
    High Level, Structured and open source language, cross platform, Huge community, Large eco system
    
    interpreted programming language(Automatically compiled into bytecode before execution by an interpreter)
       
     python is very popular language, used for multi purpose
       - Data analysis, web development, mobile development, AL/ML, automation
       
     Applications written in python
     Ex: youtube, dropbox, reddit, Instagram, Pinterest
       
2. Introduction to command line interface.(cli)
     
     Inclass
        ----------
        QUIZ - What basic tools do you need to start programming?
                  - A computer, a text editor, the shell(terminal, cli), and a compiler/interpreter
               
               What command would you use for the following in bash (CLI)?
               Check your current directory - pwd
               Change to a directory named ‘bin’ (bin is in your current directory) - cd bin
               make a new directory called ‘lib’ - mkdir lib
               create a new file called ‘book.py’ - touch book.py
               list all the contents the current directory - ls
               
      Terminology
      
      Source code - file which contain our code. (aka program, code)
      file extention for different languages.
      example.py
      example.java
      example.php
      example.pl - PERL language

3.Setting up development environment.
   Linux
   Windows
   differences of python versions 2,3 (https://www.guru99.com/python-2-vs-python-3.html)
   
   pythons has 2 major versions (not backward compatible)
      -python 2
      -python 3
      
   interpreted programming vs compile programming
     - by example - https://guide.freecodecamp.org/computer-science/compiled-versus-interpreted-languages/
     - in compiled languages the source code is tranlated directly to bytecode(which is understadable by hardware)
      ex: c, c++, Go
      you have to compile first before run.
     - In interpreted language the source is tranlated to bytecode line by line by an inbuilt interpreter.
       you can directly run the program. Ex : Python
       
     Create a python file from terminal an run it using python.
     print 'Hello Srilanka'
     
     Do the same with IDLE

  4. keywords in python.  
  
  Reserved words used in python.(https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/keyword-list)
  
  >> import keyword
  >> print(keyword.kwlist)
  'and', 'as', 'assert', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'exec', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'print', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield'
  
  cant use these for varibale name, function names or any other identifier
  
  In java keyword set is much bigger - (int, long ,  string ..)
  
  5. Identifiers 
    
    words identified by you for naming variables, functions, the programmer. You can't use keywords as identifies.
  
    NOTES : 
    identifier name starts with A to Z or a to z or _
    followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9)
    
    puctuation characters are not allowed - @, $, and % are not allowed (# can be used)
     
    Identifiers are case sensitive.
    Ex : myName and myname are two different identifiers
    
    QUIZ 1 - identify keywords and identifiers
    
    name = "Anuradha"
    print name
    
    QUIZ 2  - select invalid identifiers
    
    1. myName 
    2. _myName
    3. ___myname
    4.123myname
    5. !myname
    6. MyNaME
    7. MyNaME@$
    8. MyName#
    9.!Myname__
