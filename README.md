 4. Introduction to Python
    By Gudio van Rossum
    Named after Monty Python's Flying Circus comedy program (has 4 seasons, telecased in 1969)
    High Level, Structured and open source language
    interpreted programming language(Automatically compiled into bytecode before execution by an interpreter)
    interpreted programming vs compile programming
     - by example - https://guide.freecodecamp.org/computer-science/compiled-versus-interpreted-languages/
     - in compiled languages the source code is tranlated directly to bytecode(which is understadable by hardware)
      ex: c, c++, Go
      you have to compile first before run.
     - In interpreted language the source is tranlated to bytecode line by line by an inbuilt interpreter.
       you can directly run the program. Ex : Python
    
 5.Setting up development environment.
   Linux
   Windows
