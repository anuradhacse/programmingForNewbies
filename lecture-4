1. String as a array 

str = 'Hello World!'

print (str[:3])
print (str*2)
print (str.index('H'))
print (len(str))

doesn't support all function which worked for lists.(can't change a string)

print (str.extend('H'))
print (str.remove('H'))
print (str.append('H'))
print (str.insert('H'))

3. Python Objects

Immutable objects and mutable objects

     Immutable types: all numeric types (numbers), strings, tuples, range, bytes, frozenset
     Mutable types: lists, dictionaries, bytearray, set, classes, class instances

     Object has following values 
     
     identity - an address in memory - id(a)
     type - type (a) int
     value - 3
     
     a = 3
     b = 3 
     
     id (a)
     id (b)
    
     a is b -> True
     a and b point to same object.
     
     b = 5
     now b point to different object
  
     a is b -> False
