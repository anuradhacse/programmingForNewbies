Q1) print following

Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
	How I wonder what you are! 
		Up above the world so high,   		
		Like a diamond in the sky. 
Twinkle, twinkle, little star, 
	How I wonder what you are!
  
Q2) Write a Python program which accepts the user's first and last name and print them in reverse order with a space between them
  
 Q3) Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area. Go to the editor
Sample Output :
r = 1.1
Area = 3.8013271108436504


1. The Python variable naming rules are:
  • Must begin with a letter (a - z, A - Z) or underscore (_).
  • Other characters can be letters, numbers or _ only.
  • Names are case sensitive.
  • Reserved words cannot be used as a variable name.
  
  Use meaningful name for variables, 
  
  For a multiple-word name, use either the underscore as the delimiter (e.g., temp_var and
  interest_rate) or use camelCase capitalization
  Ex; interest_rate, interestRate
  
  case sensitivity example (not all languages are like that)
  >> myVar = 'Hello'
  >> myvar 
     undefined
  
 2. Conversion of data types.
    int -> str  
    float -> int (Ex: 1.0 -> 1)
    int -> flaot (Ex: 1.98-> 1)
    float -> str
    str -> int   - valid scenarios / invalid scenarios
    str -> float  - valid scenarios / invalid scenarios
    
 3. String concatnation
 
 str + int (invalid)
 str * int (valid)
 
 4. Lists
 
 why lists.? you can store many values in data structure easily.
 store 10 friends names using variables
 store friends names with list
 
 list can have different types of values - Heterogeneous structure (ex: strings , lists, objects, lists). 
 
 support mulitidimentional lists (list inside lists)
	 list = [ 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 , ['a', 1]]
	 print (list[5][0])
 
 errors - list index out of range
 when trying to access a element which is not in the list

QUIZ - make helloworld string into character list
b = []
b.extend("Helloworld")
print (b)

3. Python Objects

     Object has following values 
     
     identity - an address in memory - id(a)
     type - type (a) int
     value - 3
     
     a = 3
     b = 3 
     
     id (a)
     id (b)
    
     a is b -> True
     a and b point to same object.
     
     b = 5
     now b point to different object
  
     a is b -> False
