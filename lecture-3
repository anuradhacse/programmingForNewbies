1. The Python variable naming rules are:
  • Must begin with a letter (a - z, A - Z) or underscore (_).
  • Other characters can be letters, numbers or _ only.
  • Names are case sensitive.
  • Reserved words cannot be used as a variable name.
  
  Use meaningful name for variables, 
  
  For a multiple-word name, use either the underscore as the delimiter (e.g., temp_var and
  interest_rate) or use camelCase capitalization
  Ex; interest_rate, interestRate
  
  case sensitivity example (not all languages are like that)
  >> myVar = 'Hello'
  >> myvar 
     undefined
  

6. Python Objects

     Object has following values 
     
     identity - an address in memory - id(a)
     type - type (a) int
     value - 3
     
     a = 3
     b = 3 
     
     id (a)
     id (b)
    
     a is b -> True
     a and b point to same object.
     
     b = 5
     now b point to different object
  
     a is b -> False
